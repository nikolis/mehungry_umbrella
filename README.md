# Mehungry.Umbrella

## Documentating the Food Data Parser resigning in apps/Mehungry/lib/mehungry/food_data_parser.ex (this is a toy project so the documentation for the time being is just for the context of the interview process with elixirator)

The postgres password for the dev part is the default postgres postgres. 
1. mix deps.get 
2. mix ecto.create 
3. mix ecto.migrate 
4. mix run apps/mehungry/priv/repo/seeds.exs

After this the test should be running properly
